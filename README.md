# Tableau-Challenge

## Project Description
This project consisted of leveraging Tableau to create multiple visualizations, dashboards and stories.

In particular, the New York Citi Bike Program needed assistance with generating regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the program. 

Using the data for the month of September 2023, I analyzed and visualized the following relationships:
1. Start Stations per Membership Type
2. End Stations per Membership Type
3. Rider Date/Time per Day (to determine peak bike user times)
4. Rider Date/Time per Hour
5. Membership Types and corresponding enrollment totals
6. Bike Types and user totals

These visuals were inserted in dashboards, which were then put together as a story. In the story, we can view descriptions of the analysis of the insights from the visuals.

Prior to this, the data was cleaned up using python dependencies on Jupyter Notebook.

The final file was uploaded to my Tableau website for publication.
